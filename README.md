### Purpose
Microglia express a range of proteins and genes when shifting between pro- and anti-inflammatory states. These protein and gene markers create a unique pattern that translates to the microglia's extent of inflammation. Identifying and quantifying these patterns are critical to understanding inflammation dynamics in microglia, and quantifying microglial inflammation in experiments.
